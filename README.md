# Autoencoder
Autoencoder for denoising images.

We implement a simple class of an Autoencoder in order to denoise images. 
The Autoencoder is not really deep so I suspect it will have trouble with larger images.
Weights are saved in the repo, and an application with the MNIST data is provided in the notebook.

For now, it is only implemented with grey scaled images.
